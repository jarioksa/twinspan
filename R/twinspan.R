### R function to call needed parts of TWINSPAN Fortran functions. The
### original TWINSPAN was split into separate files for each
### subroutine, and this R function will call those subroutines as
### needed, but R code is used instead of FORTRAN main. This allows us
### to make the TWINSPAN work like an ordinary R function.

#' Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis
#'
#' Two-Way Indicator Analysis (TWINSPAN) is a divisive classification
#' method that works by splitting first Correspondence-Analysis into
#' two, and then recursively working with each of this split
#' subsets. The function is actually much more complicated: see
#' Details.
#'
#' @param x Input data, usually a species community data set where
#'     columns give the species and rows the sampling units.
#'
#' @export
`twinspan` <-
    function(x)
{
    .NotYetImplemented()
}
